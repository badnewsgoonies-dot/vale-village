## 📋 QA TEST PLAN

### **TEST 1: FULL GAME PLAYTHROUGH (Speedrun Path)**

**Objective:** Beat the game as fast as possible (minimal side content)

**Steps:**
1. Start new game
2. Pick Isaac as starter
3. Beat tutorial NPC
4. Recruit Garet (2nd unit)
5. Level to 3 through training NPCs
6. Equip basic gear from shop
7. Recruit Mia (healer - 3rd unit)
8. Collect 3 Djinn (minimum for boss)
9. Level to 5
10. Challenge final boss
11. Win

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Game beatable in 30-45 minutes
- [ ] No impossible difficulty spikes
- [ ] Progression feels satisfying
- [ ] No game-breaking bugs
- [ ] All systems work together

**Evidence:** Screenshot each major milestone + final victory screen

---

### **TEST 2: FULL GAME PLAYTHROUGH (Completionist Path)**

**Objective:** 100% completion (all units, all Djinn, all equipment)

**Steps:**
1. Start new game
2. Pick Garet as starter (different path than Test 1)
3. Recruit all 10 units (beat all recruitable NPCs)
4. Collect all 12 Djinn
5. Buy all equipment from shops
6. Complete all side quests
7. Level all units to 5
8. Beat final boss with different party comp

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] All 10 units recruitable
- [ ] All 12 Djinn findable
- [ ] Bench management works (pick 4 from 10)
- [ ] Different party compositions viable
- [ ] True ending triggers (if exists)

**Evidence:** Screenshot unit collection (all 10) + Djinn menu (all 12)

---

### **TEST 3: PROGRESSION VERIFICATION**

**Objective:** Prove leveling/equipment/Djinn actually matter

**Tests:**

#### **3A: Leveling Matters**
```
Setup: Save before difficult battle
Test 1: Fight with Lv2 party → Should lose
Test 2: Load save, level to Lv4, fight again → Should win
Evidence: Screenshot both battle results
```

#### **3B: Equipment Matters**
```
Setup: Save before battle
Test 1: Fight with no equipment → Should lose
Test 2: Load save, equip full gear, fight again → Should win
Evidence: Screenshot stat comparison screen + battle results
```

#### **3C: Djinn Matter**
```
Setup: Save before battle
Test 1: Fight with 0 Djinn → Should struggle
Test 2: Load save, equip 3 Venus Djinn, fight again → Should dominate
Evidence: Screenshot Djinn screen + battle results
```

#### **3D: Party Composition Matters**
```
Setup: Same boss fight
Test 1: 4 tanks (slow but tanky) → Wins slowly
Test 2: Balanced party (tank/DPS/mage/healer) → Wins faster
Test 3: 4 mages (glass cannon) → High risk/reward
Evidence: Turn count comparison + party screens
```

---

### **TEST 4: BALANCE CHECK**

**Objective:** Verify difficulty curve is appropriate

**Early Game (First 15 Minutes):**
- [ ] Tutorial battle beatable by any starter
- [ ] 2nd battle requires some strategy
- [ ] 3rd battle requires leveling OR equipment
- [ ] Player has options (grind vs shop vs recruit)

**Mid Game (15-30 Minutes):**
- [ ] Battles require full party (4 units)
- [ ] Equipment progression noticeable
- [ ] Djinn become important
- [ ] Strategy matters (not just stats)

**Late Game (30-45 Minutes):**
- [ ] Boss requires Lv4+ units
- [ ] Boss requires 6+ Djinn equipped
- [ ] Boss requires good equipment
- [ ] Boss requires smart ability use

**Red Flags:**
⚠️ Tutorial impossible (too hard)
⚠️ Boss too easy (no challenge)
⚠️ No reason to level (stats don't matter)
⚠️ Grinding required (feels tedious)

---

### **TEST 5: INTEGRATION VERIFICATION**

**Objective:** All systems work together

- [ ] Enemy team matches NPC's difficulty
- [ ] Player party carries over correctly
- [ ] Return to overworld after battle

#### **Battle → Rewards:**
- [ ] Win battle → Rewards screen shows XP/money/items
- [ ] XP applies to correct units
- [ ] Money adds to inventory
- [ ] Level up notification if threshold reached

#### **Rewards → Equipment:**
- [ ] Equipment drops add to inventory
- [ ] Can immediately equip new gear
- [ ] Stat changes reflect in next battle

#### **Recruitment:**
- [ ] Defeat recruitable NPC → Recruitment screen
- [ ] Accept recruitment → Unit in collection
