## ChatGPT Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Hi! I've created an HTML mockup for a Golden Sun-style RPG overworld with companion 
sprites that follow the player character. Can you help me view and review it?

The mockup demonstrates a "follow-the-leader" pattern where:
- The player character (Isaac) is at the front
- 3 party members (Garet, Ivan, Mia) follow in a line
- Each companion smoothly follows the previous character's position
- Movement is animated with staggered timing

Please:
1. Render this HTML in Canvas
2. Show me a screenshot of what it looks like
3. Describe the visual layout and party formation
4. If possible, test the movement controls (arrow buttons or keyboard)
5. Suggest any visual improvements or issues you notice

Here's the complete HTML file:
```

## Next Step: Paste the HTML

After pasting the prompt above, **paste the entire contents** of this file:

```
/workspace/mockups/improved/overworld-companion-sprites.html
```

You can get the contents by running:
```bash
cat /workspace/mockups/improved/overworld-companion-sprites.html
```

## What ChatGPT Will Show You

✅ **Visual Screenshot** - See the party formation in action

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use ChatGPT-4** or newer for best HTML rendering
2. **Canvas mode** works best for interactive previews
3. **Ask follow-up questions** about specific design choices
4. **Request variations** if you want to see different layouts
5. **Save the conversation** so you can iterate on feedback

## Example Follow-up Questions for ChatGPT

After viewing the mockup, you can ask:

- "How does the spacing between companions look? Should they be closer?"
- "Can you adjust the colors to be more authentic to Golden Sun?"
- "What if we added idle animations to each character?"
- "How would this look with real sprite GIFs instead of emoji?"
- "Can you create a variant with 2 companions instead of 3?"
