## Progression Without Quests

### Instead of Quest Objectives:
❌ **"Collect 10 herbs from the forest"**
✅ **"Defeat 3 opponents in the training yard"**

❌ **"Find the lost item in the cave"**
✅ **"Win your tournament bracket to unlock Sanctum"**

❌ **"Talk to 5 villagers"**
✅ **"Face the Mercury Guardian to learn Ice techniques"**

### How Players Progress:
1. **Win battles** → Advance story
2. **Lose battles** → Learn from defeat, retry with new strategy
3. **Master techniques** → Unlock harder opponents
4. **Complete challenges** → Earn titles and recognition

---

## Dialogue & Cutscenes

### Pre-Battle Dialogue
**Purpose**: Set context, build tension
**Example**:
> _Elder: "Your opponent today is Alex, a Mercury prodigy. He's never lost a match. Show him what determination can achieve."_

### Mid-Battle Commentary
**Purpose**: Reactive storytelling based on battle flow
**Example**:
> _"Isaac's Earthquake shattered the enemy's defenses!"_
> _"Garet is down! This battle isn't over yet!"_

### Post-Battle Resolution
**Purpose**: Reflect on growth, set up next challenge
**Example (Victory)**:
> _Alex: "I... lost? Perhaps I relied too much on talent and not enough on strategy. Well fought."_

**Example (Defeat)**:
> _Elder: "You fought bravely, but Alex's experience showed. Learn from this - watch how he controlled the flow of battle."_
