# 🤝 CLAUDE CODE HANDOFF SEQUENCE - Vale Chronicles

**How to execute the 6-role workflow with separate Claude Code chats in Cursor**

---

## 🎯 REPOSITORY SETUP

### **Repository:** 
```
C:\Dev\AiGames\Zzzzzzzzz\vale-chronicles\
```

**This is your MAIN repository for Vale Chronicles.**

**DON'T use:**
- ❌ `MetaPrompt/` - That's the reference project
- ❌ `NextEraGame/` - That's the reference project
- ❌ `Zzzzzzzzz/` root - Keep it clean

**DO use:**
- ✅ `vale-chronicles/` - Your new game project

---

## 📋 WORKFLOW SEQUENCE

### **You'll Create 6 Separate Claude Code Sessions in Cursor:**

```
Session 1: 📖 Story Director
Session 2: 🎨 Graphics Mockup  
Session 3: 🏛️ Architect
Session 4: 💻 Coder
Session 5: ✨ Graphics Integration
Session 6: ✅ QA/Verifier
```

**Each session gets ONE role, completes their work, hands off to next session.**

**TIP:** Use Cursor's "New Chat" feature to start fresh sessions for each role!
